# look up! ◔‿◔<sup>🌸</sup>

A lookup page for emoticons, inspired by the late [emojicons.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20230407030512/http://emojicons.com/home).

Click [here](https://sirs0ri.github.io/look-up) to open the tool!

If you wanna help me categorize the emotes, feel free to head over to [the categorizer](https://sirs0ri.github.io/look-up/categorize) and flip through some tags. Your votes will be stored automatically in a cookie 🍪.
When you're done, press "export", and send me the .json file it spits out, for example by attatching it to a new issue [here](https://github.com/Sirs0ri/look-up/issues/new). 

Thanks! ヘ( ^o^)ノ＼(^_^ )
